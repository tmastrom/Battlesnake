# Battlesnake 2019 Entry

A simple [Battlesnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written in Python. This snake was forked from the [starter snake repo](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/starter-snake-python/fork) and deployed to [Heroku](https://tommy-yum.herokuapp.com/) for the competition.  

Check out my snake and others at the [Battlesnake Arena](https://play.battlesnake.io/)!
